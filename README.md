# ColorGraph
This repository introduces a benchmark problem for the evaluation of an automated design method’s ability to solve design decision tree problems that are multimodal, opaque, unbounded, and contain an ever-increasing number possible modification as the complexity grows. The test problem is highly analogous to many complex design problems of interest, but solutions to it can be evaluated quickly with minimal computational resources. This enables rapid testing of automated design algorithms. Within these files, we include a Monte Carlo Tree Search, two Genetic Algorithms, and Ant Colony Optimization. The algorithms are compared to each other on the Color Graph problem.
